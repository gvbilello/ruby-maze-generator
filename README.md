RUBY MAZE GENERATOR

This app uses the Ruby gem 'Gosu' to create and draw mazes using a maze height, maze width, and cell width.
Default settings are as follows:
maze width: 800, maze height: 800, cell width: 10
(Note: Gosu Window object is 20 pixels larger in both height and width to accomodate for a small 10px border around the maze)

Examples:

800x800 maze with cell width of 100
